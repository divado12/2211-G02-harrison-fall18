\underline{\textbf{Course Description}} \par
This is a calculus based introduction to mechanics and is the first course in a two-semester Physics sequence that is a requirement for Physics and pre-Engineering majors.
The prerequisite for this course is MATH 1450 with concurrent enrollment in MATH 2460 and PHYS 2211L (lab).
The lecture is three credits while the lab is one credit. (see the lab syllabus for more details)
\hfill \break

\underline{\textbf{Course Content}} \par
We will be covering Part 1 (“Mechanics”) of the textbook which consists of 14 chapters.
We will cover approximately one chapter and one corresponding lab per week (see the lab syllabus for more details).
A detailed schedule can be found at the end of this syllabus.
\hfill \break

\underline{\textbf{Expected Course Outcomes}} \par
The objective of the course is to have the student learn and be proficient in the application of the basic laws of mechanics.
After having taken this course, the student should be able to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item interpret physical situations as stated in word problems
\item be able to identify the physical laws appropriate to the physical situation at hand
\item be able to use mathematics/physical law as a tool for predicting behavior of mechanical systems
\item be able to use computers/sensors as tools for experimental investigation of physical law
\item be able to represent physical systems in multiple representations, e.g. mathematically, pictorially, graphically, etc.
\item be able to use various technologies as tools for scientific endeavor
\end{enumerate}
\hfill \break

\underline{\textbf{Means of Assessment and Grading Scheme}} \par
There will be several exams during the semester as well as several short quizzes.
Exams will be announced at least one week in advance, quizzes may occasionally be unannounced.
You will be provided with a ``clicker'' for answering in-class polls and practice problems; clicker questions will count as part of your participation grade.
Homework assignments will be given on a fairly regular basis via WebAssign.
The final exam is comprehensive and mandatory. \par
\hfill \break
Average of quizzes and exams: 50\% \par
WebAssign HW: 25\% \par
Participation: 25\%
